# 🧠 Processing Units in a Computer

A **processing unit** is the part of a computer system that carries out instructions from programs through basic operations like arithmetic, logic, control, and data manipulation. It's often referred to as the **"brain"** of the computer.

---

## 🧩 Types of Processing Units

### 1. **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**

- The primary processing unit of a computer.
- Executes instructions from programs using the **control unit (CU)** and **arithmetic logic unit (ALU)**.
- Typically consists of:
  - **ALU** – Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
  - **CU** – Directs the flow of data and instructions.
  - **Registers** – Small, fast storage areas within the CPU.

**Example:** Intel Core i7, AMD Ryzen 7

TOPIC 3:

# 🏗️ Memory Hierarchy in Computer Architecture

The **Memory Hierarchy** is the structure that organizes different types of memory in a computer system based on **speed**, **cost**, and **size**.

The idea is to use faster, more expensive memory closer to the CPU, and slower, cheaper memory farther away.

---

## 🪜 Memory Hierarchy (Top to Bottom)
Memory Type | Characteristics |
+------------------+----------------------+
| CPU Registers | Fastest, most expensive, smallest |
| Cache Memory | Very fast, limited size (L1, L2, L3) |
| Main Memory (RAM) | Moderate speed and size |
| Secondary Storage | Large size, slower (HDD, SSD) |
| Tertiary Storage | Very large, very slow (Cloud, Tape) |

      +----------------+
      |  CPU Registers |
      +----------------+
      |    Cache (L1)  |
      +----------------+
      |     Cache (L2) |
      +----------------+
      |     RAM (Main) |
      +----------------+
      |   SSD / HDD    |
      +----------------+
      |  Cloud / Tape  |

## 🔍 Key Concepts

| Level     | Memory Type      | Speed      | Size       | Cost         | Volatility |
|-----------|------------------|------------|------------|--------------|------------|
| L0        | Registers         | 🔥 Fastest | 🧠 Very small | 💸 Very high | Volatile   |
| L1        | Cache (L1, L2, L3)| 🔥🔥 Very fast | 🧠 Small     | 💰 High      | Volatile   |
| L2        | RAM (Main Memory) | ⚡ Fast     | 📦 Medium   | 💵 Moderate  | Volatile   |
| L3        | SSD / HDD         | 🐢 Slower   | 📦 Large    | 💵 Lower     | Non-volatile |
| L4        | Tertiary (Cloud)  | 🐌 Slowest  | 🌐 Massive  | 💲 Low       | Non-volatile |

---

## 🧠 Why Is Memory Hierarchy Important?

- **Speed:** Accessing data from registers is nearly instant; from HDDs, it's much slower.
- **Efficiency:** Frequently used data is stored in faster memory to reduce lag.
- **Cost Management:** Faster memory costs more, so it's used sparingly.

---

## 🧩 Real-Life Analogy

Imagine you're working on a desk:

- **Registers** = Things in your hand (fastest to reach)
- **Cache** = Items on your desk (very quick access)
- **RAM** = Drawer in your desk (slightly slower)
- **SSD/HDD** = Filing cabinet in another room
- **Cloud Storage** = Documents stored in a warehouse across the city

# Pop element
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 20

TOPIC 5:
# 🧠 Computability Theory

**Computability Theory** (also known as **Theory of Computation**) is a branch of theoretical computer science that explores what problems can be solved using algorithms — and how efficiently they can be solved.

It helps us understand the **limits of computation**.

---

## 📌 Why Is It Important?

- Defines the boundary between what **can** and **cannot** be computed.
- Provides the foundation for programming languages and algorithms.
- Answers key questions like:
  - Is this problem solvable?
  - Can it be solved efficiently?

---

## 🧩 Key Concepts in Computability Theory

### 1. **Turing Machine**
- A mathematical model of a computer.
- Introduced by **Alan Turing** in 1936.
- Can simulate any algorithmic computation.
- Foundation for defining what is **computable**.

🧾 Think of it like a simple, idealized computer with:
- A tape (memory)
- A head (reads/writes symbols)
- A finite set of instructions

### 2. **Decidability**
- A problem is **decidable** if an algorithm exists that gives a **yes/no answer** in a finite number of steps.
- A problem is **undecidable** if **no such algorithm** exists.

✅ Example (Decidable): Checking if a number is prime  
❌ Example (Undecidable): Halting Problem

### 3. **The Halting Problem**
- Given a program and an input, will it eventually stop (halt)?
- Proven by Turing to be **undecidable** — no general algorithm can solve it for all programs.

### 4. **Languages and Automata**
- Computability theory is closely related to **formal languages**.
- Machines used to study them include:
  - **Finite Automata**: For regular languages
  - **Pushdown Automata**: For context-free languages
  - **Turing Machines**: For recursively enumerable languages

|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Decidable**         | Can be solved by an algorithm                                |
| **Undecidable**       | No algorithm exists to solve it                              |
| **Semi-decidable**    | Algorithm may give correct answer, but might run forever     |

---

## 🧠 Real-World Analogy

Imagine you're solving a puzzle:

- **Decidable**: You know there’s always a solution and you can follow a method to get it.
- **Undecidable**: You don’t know if the puzzle even has a solution — you could try forever.

---

## 💡 Summary

- Computability theory explores what **can** be solved by computers.
- Uses mathematical models like **Turing Machines**.
- Helps us identify **decidable** vs. **undecidable** problems.
- Basis for understanding **algorithms**, **languages**, and **automation**.

### 🔸 Shannon’s Information Theory
- Proposed by **Claude Shannon** in 1948.
- Introduced the concept of **Entropy (H)**:
  > \( H(X) = -\sum P(x) \log_2 P(x) \)
- Measures the average information content per symbol.

### 🔐 Applications:
- Data compression (ZIP, MP3)
- Error detection & correction (parity bits, Hamming code)
- Communication networks (Wi-Fi, 4G/5G)

---

## 🔐 CRYPTOGRAPHY

**Cryptography** is the science of **securing information** by transforming it into an unreadable format to prevent unauthorized access.

### 🔹 Goals of Cryptography (CIA Triad)

| Goal            | Description                                 |

| **Integrity**       | Ensure data is not altered                |
| **Availability**    | Ensure data is accessible when needed     |

### 🔸 Types of Cryptography

#### 1. **Symmetric Key Cryptography**
- Same key used for encryption and decryption
- **Faster** but requires secure key exchange
- Example: **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**

```plaintext
Plaintext + Key → Encrypted Text
Encrypted Text + Same Key → Plaintext

# 🚀 Programming Language Performance Comparison

Programming languages differ in terms of **performance**, **speed**, **memory usage**, and **use cases**. Choosing the right language often depends on what you're building — from high-speed systems to web apps or data science tools.

## 🧪 What Does "Performance" Mean?

Performance can be measured by:

- **Execution speed** – How fast the program runs
- **Memory usage** – How much RAM the program uses
- **Startup time** – Time it takes to begin executing
- **Efficiency** – CPU usage, garbage collection, etc.

---

## 📊 General Performance Comparison

🟢 = High performance  
🟡 = Average performance  
🔴 = Lower performance (but good for rapid development)
